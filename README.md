# haikuChallenge

A traditional haiku is a type of short-form poetry which originated in Japan. They are formed by three lines of 5, 7 and 5 syllables. The task this week is to write an algorithm which can determine if a given poem is a haiku or not. Each line of these sample poems (in English) are separated with a /, you can expect to find commas, apostrophes and various other punctuation.

## Rewards:

- seven: Points are awarded for correctly determining whether each of the sample problems are haikus or not.
- two: Further points are awarded for reading each haiku aloud (text-to-speech)
- one: Further point is awarded for using a language or technology unique among other participants

Example:
For the following poem:
"Slow moving river. / Flash of iridescent blue. / A kingfisher strikes"
the syllable count is 5, 7 and 5 respectively. Therefore your algorithm would return true
